# Introduction ðŸŽ®
The video games industry is a dynamic and rapidly evolving sector, driven by changing consumer preferences. This video games dashboard aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of video game sales data to uncover insights that can inform business strategies.

# Methodology
This dataset contains data from more than 16.500 games sold worldwide, from 1980 to 2020, including Game Name, Platform, Year, Genre, Publisher, Sales, and Region. The data was generated by a scrape of vgchartz.com.
Power Query and Power BI have been employed to extract insights from the dataset.

Due to unavailable data in 2017-2019, I only consider data from 1980 - 2016 to have uninterrupted data insights.
